# CHIP8 emulator
A CHIP8 emulator written in C++. Built as a hobby to refresh my programming skills.
As of now (20-02-2026), I plan to at least make it a functional normal CHIP8 emulator.
But I can see myself expanding it to SUPERCHIP or other functionalities, maybe a nice debugger, etc.

My main focuses were project structuring, documentation and keeping a clear overview.

## Usage
```./chip8 <rom_path>```

## Test roms passed
- IBM Logo ROM
